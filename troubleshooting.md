# Troubleshooting
## Someone asked for my log - what is it?
If you ask for help with a technical issue, it is likely that somoeone will ask for your log (also known as ``Log.txt``) - this is a file that x-plane writes which contains any errors that are experienced.

 * It is found in the root of your X-Plane folder (Likely ``C://X-Plane 11/Log.txt`` or ``Desktop/X-Plane 11/Log.txt`` on Windows, other OSes may vary)
 * It is **rewritten on every startup**, so if you have an issue with the 787, you need to load up x-plane, select the 787 and wait for it to load, then quit X-Plane.
 * You should always **upload** the **whole** file 
 * **Do not** send screenshots of bits of it
 * **Do not** copy and paste it (it can be very long)
 * **Do not** edit it in any way
