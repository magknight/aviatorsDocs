The existing documentation for the Hoppie network is somewhat sparce, so here are some of my findings from developing the 787 ACARS features.

The live web server is at ``http://www.hoppie.nl/acars/system/connect.html``.
Most of my requests are handled by async GET requests. 
**Every** request should have logon code and callsign:
``connect.html?logon=${logonCode}&from=${callsign}``

## Requests
### VATSIM ATIS
```
type=inforeq
packet=vatatis+icao
```
such as 
```
type=inforeq
packet=vatatis+EGKK
```

### METAR
```
to=SERVER
type=inforeq
packet=metar+icao
```
such as 
```
to=SERVER
type=inforeq
packet=metar+EGKK
```

### TAF
```
to=SERVER
type=inforeq
packet=taf+icao
```
such as 
```
to=SERVER
type=inforeq
packet=taf+EGKK
```

### PDC/DCL
Pre-departure clearance is the other fairly simple thing to do, and it's supported by the majority of ATC clients. 
```
to=atcFacility
type=telex
packet=REQUEST PREDEP CLEARANCE
${callsign} ${acType} TO ${destinationIcao}
AT ${departureIcao} STAND ${stand}
ATIS ${atisLetter}
```
such as 
```
to=EGKK
type=telex
packet=REQUEST PREDEP CLEARANCE
TOM9AG B789 TO LEPA
AT EGKK STAND 49
ATIS Y
```

## Responses
To get the response to the request, assuming it isn't an inforeq, you need to POLL.
### Poll
To get messages from the server, you poll for them. Use a get request, and do it every 30 seconds (ish)
```
to=SERVER
type=poll
```
#### Things you might get as a response
```
ok {LOVV cpdlc {/data2/15//WU/CONTACT @WIEN SOUTH CTR@ @133.80}}
```
They come in the format of:
```
ok {${facility} ${type} {${packet}}} {${facility} ${type} {${packet}}} {${facility} ${type} {${packet}}}
```
If there are no messages, you'll just get a response of
```
ok 
```
Noting the space that comes after ``ok``.
This took me an absolute age to figure out, so my code for managing splitting the response into useful data is:

```lua
if result == "ok " then -- no messages there, just finish
    return true
end

if string.sub(result, 1, 3) == "ok " then -- if the result is still ok
    message = string.gsub(result, "^ok", "") -- get rid of the ok bit
    local messageTable = {}
    for row in string.gmatch(message, " {.-}}") do -- split by outer {}
        row = string.gsub(row, "{%d- ", "{") -- get rid of random numbers that show up
        from, type, packet = string.match(row, "{(%w-) (%w-) {(.-)}") -- split message to 3 var
        if packet ~= "" then -- if there is a packet, send it to the packet sorting stuff
            sortPacket(from, type, variable)
        end
    end
end
```
