# Aircraft/Livery settings files
From version 1.1.9 onwards, the **787**: Aviator's Edition supports per-livery, and per-variant configurations, handled by settings files located in the root of the livery folder, and in the settings folder in the root of the aircraft folder.

## Global settings 
Global settings are stored in the ``./settings``[^1] folder. In this folder, you'll find 3 files: 
```
defaultGlobalSettings.json
defaultLiverySettings.json
globalSettings.json
```
If ``defaultGlobalSettings.json`` is missing, the aircraft __will crash on startup__. The other two files will be auto-generated by the plane if they are missing.
[^1]: For example, ``C:\X-Plane 11/Aircraft/Magknight787/settings/``

### defaultGlobalSettings.json
This file contains the default settings, both those that are stored globally and the default livery settings. The settings here __will be__ overwritten by the updater on each launch, so the file should not be edited. All other settings files override the settings of this file; it simply acts as a backup to these files.

### defaultLiverySettings.json
This file contains the settings for the default livery. As with all livery settings included with the aicraft, it will be overwritten by the updater during each minor or major release. We don't reccomend changing settings in this file.

### globalSettings.json
This file contains user settings, that are stored globally. This file won't be overwritten by the updater.
